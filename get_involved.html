              <section id="volunteer_opportunities">
                <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
                <p>Are you interested in volunteering? Do you have tech skills and want to share those with the community? Do you have other skills that aren't necessarily tech skills that can still help? If so, we'd be happy to have you. There are no time commitments for volunteering. Volunteer as little or as much as you would like.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in volunteering for the first time, we will invite you to attend our next bi-monthly volunteer get together and training. This is an optional event for our existing volunteers, but we highly encourage everyone who volunteers to attend to meet new volunteers and socialize and get to know our other volunteers better.</p>
                <p>To keep our community safe and healthy we require that all volunteers wear masks when attending in-person events. This helps make sure that we are not still contributing to the spread of COVID and other communicable diseases that are harmful and dangerous to our immunocompromised and disabled community members.</p>
                <p>Here is an overview of our opportunities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Tech Support</li>
                  <p>Provide free technical assistance to community members, including troubleshooting, repairs, setup, and advice for various devices and software.</p>
                  <li>Teaching</li>
                  <p>Lead or assist with classes covering a range of topics, from basic device usage to more advanced skills like coding or IT support.</p>
                  <li>Community Outreach</li>
                  <p>Build connections with local organizations, promote the network's services, and raise awareness to attract participants and volunteers.</p>
                  <li>Purchasing and Procurement</li>
                  <p>Manage sourcing and purchasing of tech supplies, tools, and other resources needed for classes, tech support, and community donations.</p>
                  <li>Device Refurbishment and Repair</li>
                  <p>Assess and repair donated devices, ensuring they are functional and ready to be distributed to community members in need.</p>
                  <li>Fundraising and Grant Writing</li>
                  <p>Help secure funding by writing grant proposals, organizing fundraisers, or reaching out to local businesses and sponsors.</p>
                  <li>Web Development and Content Management</li>
                  <p>Maintain and update the network's website, upload class schedules and recordings, and manage a potential blog or other digital tools.</p>
                  <li>Event Planning and Logistics</li>
                  <p>Coordinate in-person classes, tech support drop-ins, and other events, ensuring all logistical needs - space, equipment, and volunteers - are met.</p>
                  <li>Translation and Accessibility Services</li>
                  <p>Translate materials into multiple languages and ensure that resources and events are accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
                  <li>Communications and Social Media</li>
                  <p>Manage social media platforms, write newsletters, and create promotional materials to engage with the community and share updates.</p>
                  <li>Inventory and Resource Management</li>
                  <p>Organize and catalog donated devices and supplies, and track distributed resources to ensure effective use of donations.</p>
                </ul>

If you volunteering at an in-person event, we will provide things like a computer and tools like screwdrivers, tweazers, canned air, and more unless you would like to bring your own. If you are working remote, you will need to use your own computer if one is needed. We don't use remote software, so you won't need to install anything on your computer. The computer is just nice for researching issues while working.
